# 200 - Set up your first integration

On the Getting Started page at https://dashboard.doppler.com/workplace/364b965877a9404c6493/getting-started click the drop-down ``>``.

It states: 

```
Doppler connects to a growing list of providers to keep your secrets in sync wherever you develop and deploy. Set up your first integration to automatically sync secrets from Doppler to a third-party service.
```

If the **Integrations ->** button is greyed-out, hover over it will tell you: ```Create a project in order to set up an integration```. Refresh the page if you have previously already created a project (such as [agility-game-kener](https://dashboard.doppler.com/workplace/364b965877a9404c6493/projects)). The **Integrations ->** button will now be active, click it (if you wanted you could also choose ```skip for now```).

From the Projects, pick the project you want to use integrations with (here: ```agility-game-kener```).

Then, on the project's page, on the right-top side you click the **Integrations** button.
