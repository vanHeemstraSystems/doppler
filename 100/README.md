# 100 - Introduction

[Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/) is a SecretOps platform that allows you to share and sync developer secrets across all environments. Rather than manually setting environment variables via .env files, Doppler allows you to run an executable that injects the latest version of secrets into your binary or configuration files before execution.
